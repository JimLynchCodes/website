  ## What we do

  We are working on the [Mobus Operandi website](https://github.com/mobusoperandi/website)
  and on some Rust web development tooling that may eventually be published for general use.

  This includes some advanced topics such as futures, streams and reactive programming.

status: !Open |
  ## We're open for more participants

  We're looking for experienced developers who are reasonable competent with Rust.

  For more details and application, see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mightyiam/6618d6ae649dc26ef485a21ccfe1eb3e).
